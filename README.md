# CognitiveEscapeRL

The cognitive escape reinforcement learning (CERL) method is applied to two complex decision-making tasks: visual navigation task and grid maze exploration task in the minigrid environment.


1. For the navigation experiments, run the following Python scripts:

    train_CERL.py: This script trains a model using the CERL method.

    train_CRL.py: This script trains a model using the CRL method.


2. For the minigrid experiments,
   install the minigrid environment, please refer to:  https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files
   then execute the provided shell script: bash uncertainty_experiment.sh
