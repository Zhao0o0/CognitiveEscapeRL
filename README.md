# CognitiveEscapeRL

The cognitive escape reinforcement learning (CERL) method is applied to two complex decision-making tasks: visual navigation task and grid maze exploration task in the minigrid environment.

For the navigation experiments, run the following Python scripts:

train_CERL.py: This script trains a model using the CERL method.
train_CRL.py: This script trains a model using the CRL method.

For the minigrid experiments, execute the provided shell script:
bash uncertainty_experiment.sh
